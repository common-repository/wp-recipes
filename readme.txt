== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get a 404 if I visit the recipe post on the site =

Make sure you update your permalink structure. Just opening the Settings -> Permalinks admin page should suffice. This is mandatory, the plugin needs the proper permalinks structure before beieng able to serve them on your site.
Preferably set the permalinks to custom: "/%category%/%postname%/" after installing the plugin. This is good for your seo and site usability as well.

= I get a php include error on a recipe page or archive on the site =

After installing the plugin, you need to copy two template files from the plugin folder (/wp-content/plugins/wp-recipes/templates/) to your active theme folder (/wp-content/themes/your-theme/).
You may need to customise these template files to your needs if you're using a custom theme. These template files are set up to work in the default wordpress theme (twentyten).
